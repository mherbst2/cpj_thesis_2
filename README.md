# Seeking Truth in Time of War
- Journalism is an essential part of our democracy as it keeps those in power accountable, informs citizens and acts as the unofficial fourth branch of government. The dashboard is a tribute to all journalists who have lost their lives in the pursuit of truth and justice. 

- “Stop targeting truth and truth-tellers,” said Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General. “As journalists stand up for truth, the world stands with them.”

- Since 1992, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has documented the killings of 1,687 journalists around the world. The CPJ is an independent organization that helps protect the rights of journalists by promoting the freedom of the press. They track whether journalists were murdered, died during crossfire or on a dangerous assignment. On average, about 140 journalists are killed globally per month. 

## Reference
-  Committee to Protect Journalists

## Code setup
- I first scraped the CPJ website in order to get the data I needed for my thesis. I decided to use streamlit in order to streamline my graphs and data prject as a whole.

## Data Acquisition
- For my data acquisition, I acquired the data from the CPJ website. Then, I created a Jupyter Notebook to further assess the data.
